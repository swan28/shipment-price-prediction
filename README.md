# Shipment Price Prdecition

## **The Shipment Price Prediction project aims to solve the problem of accurately estimating how much it will cost to ship goods. This is especially important for companies involved in logistics and supply chain management.**

Here's is the simplified explaination of the problem:

### *Business Need:* 
- Companies that transport goods need to nkow in advance how much a shipment will cost. Right now, calculating thses costs can be complicated because they depend on many factors, like weight of the shipment, the distance it needs to travel, and the shipping method (air, sea, road)

### *Goal:*
- The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning(a type of advanced computer program) to predict shipping costs more accurately.  By feeding the program data about previous shipments, it will learn to estimate future costs based on patterns it finds.

### *Why it's useful:*
Predicting shipping prices can help businesses:
1. Save money by choosing the most cost-effective shipping options.
2. Plan better by knowing the costs in advance.
3. Improve overall efficiency, making the whole shipping process smoother.

Walmart as one of the world's largest retailers with its vast supply chain network, walmart can optimize its shipment processes with a focus on reduucing costs and imporving delivery through price predictions.

#### *Logistics*
 - Logistics refers to the process of planning, implementing, controlling the efficient flow and storage of goods, services, and information from the point of origin(like a factory/warehouse) to the pioint of consumption(usually the custoemr).

#### *Supply Chain Management(SCM)*
 - SCM is a broader concept that covers the entire process of creating and delivering a product, form sourcing raw materials to delivering the final product to the customer.
